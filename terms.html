            <h2 class="text-xl uppercase tracking-wider border-b border-amber-500/20 pb-2">Agreement to Our Legal Terms</h2>
            <p>These Legal Terms constitute a legally binding agreement made between you and Zachary Zimmerman ("Company," "we," "us," or "our"), concerning your access to and use of the Daily Grid mobile application (the "App") and related services (the "Services").</p>
            
            <p>You agree that by accessing the Services, you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by all of these Legal Terms. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ALL OF THESE LEGAL TERMS, THEN YOU ARE EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED FROM USING THE SERVICES AND YOU MUST DISCONTINUE USE IMMEDIATELY.</p>

            <h2>1. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</h2>
            <p>You acknowledge that these Legal Terms are concluded between you and Zachary Zimmerman only, and not with Apple Inc. ("Apple"). Zachary Zimmerman, not Apple, is solely responsible for the App and the content thereof.</p>

            <h2>2. LICENSE GRANT</h2>
            <p>We grant you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the App on any Apple-branded products that you own or control and as permitted by the Usage Rules set forth in the Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions, except that such App may be accessed and used by other accounts associated with the purchaser via Family Sharing or volume purchasing.</p>

            <h2>3. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS</h2>
            <p>We are the owner or the licensee of all intellectual property rights in our Services, including source code, databases, functionality, software, designs, text, photographs, and graphics. The Content and Marks are provided "AS IS" for your personal, non-commercial use only.</p>

            <h2>4. MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT</h2>
            <p>Zachary Zimmerman is solely responsible for providing any maintenance and support services with respect to the App, as specified in these Legal Terms or as required under applicable law. You acknowledge that Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the App.</p>

            <h2>5. WARRANTY</h2>
            <p>Zachary Zimmerman is solely responsible for any product warranties, whether express or implied by law, to the extent not effectively disclaimed. In the event of any failure of the App to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price for the App to you. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the App, and any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty will be our sole responsibility.</p>

            <h2>6. PRODUCT CLAIMS</h2>
            <p>You acknowledge that Zachary Zimmerman, not Apple, is responsible for addressing any claims of the user or any third party relating to the App or the user’s possession and/or use of that App, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the App fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection, privacy, or similar legislation.</p>

            <h2>7. USER REPRESENTATIONS</h2>
            <p>By using the Services, you represent and warrant that: (1) you have the legal capacity and you agree to comply with these Legal Terms; (2) you are not a minor in the jurisdiction in which you reside; (3) you will not access the Services through automated or non-human means; (4) you will not use the Services for any illegal purpose; and (5) your use of the Services will not violate any applicable law.</p>

            <h2>8. PURCHASES AND PAYMENT</h2>
            <p>We accept payments through the Apple App Store. You agree to provide current, complete, and accurate purchase and account information for all purchases made via the Services. Sales tax will be added where required. We may change prices at any time.</p>

            <h2>9. SUBSCRIPTIONS</h2>
            <p><strong>Billing and Renewal:</strong> Your subscription will continue and automatically renew unless canceled. The length of your billing cycle is monthly.</p>
            <p><strong>Cancellation:</strong> Users can cancel a subscription through their Apple ID account settings. Daily Grid does not directly process or control subscription billing or cancellations — this is done exclusively by Apple.</p>

            <h2>10. LEGAL COMPLIANCE</h2>
            <p>You represent and warrant that (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country; and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.</p>

            <h2>11. THIRD-PARTY TERMS OF AGREEMENT</h2>
            <p>You must comply with applicable third-party terms of agreement when using our App (e.g., your wireless data service agreement).</p>

            <h2>12. THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY</h2>
            <p>You acknowledge and agree that Apple, and Apple’s subsidiaries, are third-party beneficiaries of these Legal Terms, and that, upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of these Legal Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Legal Terms against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof.</p>

            <h2>13. PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES</h2>
            <p>You may not access or use the Services for any purpose other than that for which we make them available. Prohibited activities include systematically retrieving data, defrauding other users, circumventing security features, and using the App for unauthorized commercial purposes.</p>

            <h2>14. GOVERNING LAW</h2>
            <p>These Legal Terms and your use of the Services are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida, without regard to its conflict of law principles.</p>

            <h2>15. LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY</h2>
            <p>IN NO EVENT WILL WE OR OUR DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, OR AGENTS BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES.</p>
